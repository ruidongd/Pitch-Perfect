# Pitch-Perfect
My first IOS app when I study developing on Udacity. Also the first project I completely developed on github.

## Record
Just pressing the record button to record your voice.

## Effect
There are six effects to play for fun.
The first one is to slow down your speaking speed to half of original speed.
The second is to speed up 50%.
The third one is to imitate like a chipmunk and fourth one is to speak like the Darth Vader.

## Future Features
I am still thinking of how to make some implementations based on this simple app.
